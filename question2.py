""" Question Two

Design and implement an algorithm that takes: a list containing n distinct natural numbers and a number k â‰¤ n and
calculates the sum of the k largest numbers in the array. For example, if the list is {3, 7, 5, 12, 6} and k = 3, then
the algorithm should return 25= (12+7+6).

Implement the algorithm in python [5] """
