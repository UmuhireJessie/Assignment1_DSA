"""State the Big O-notation and implement the algorithm that perform the following operations:

The algorithm takes as input a list of numbers which may contain duplicates. It returns true if
all elements of the list occur an odd number of times. Otherwise it returns false. For example, on the
list {1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2} it returns true, but on the list {1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 5} it returns false because
5 occurs an even number of times. [5] """
